SuperHeroes App
==================================

Introduction
------------

In this pathway I've learned the basics of Material Design, and how to add simple animations to your app. Now it is time to put what I've learned into practice.

In this practice set, I will build on the concepts I've learned in this pathway by creating a Superheroes app. This app focuses on creating the components necessary to build a scrollable list and a polished UI using the Material Design principles I've learned in Material Theming with Jetpack Compose codelab.
